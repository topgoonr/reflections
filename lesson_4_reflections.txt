Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

branches operate on a single repository

clone allows you to clone the repository and create your separate copy of the repository that can be edited/committed independently

fork -- is a terminology that is used on Github to describe a clone that is attributed. It will retain who the original repository belonged to. You can still edit it independently.
